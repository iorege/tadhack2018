 - using apidaze API, we created a demo solution for schools

# Scenario

 - teachers are not so into talking with parents about their kid's performance all the time
 - parents hate spending time at school getting informed about their child's degrees / attendaces
 - teenagers tend to lie in order to not get grounded

# Solution provided

 teachers' perspective :
 - the teacher configures an online catalogue on our app
 - he adds the phone numbers of the parents in his class
 - he updates the degrees for all his students and the number of absences
 
 parents' perspective :
 - the parents are provided a phone number that they can call
 - on this number, a script provides info regarding their child
 - based on that info, they can act on time and help their kid
 
 kid's perspective :
 - "geez.. nasty programmers making my life so haaaard" 
 - they will try to get more inventive about it (which is cool)
